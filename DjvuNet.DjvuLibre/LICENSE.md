This project code files and binaries are double licensed under GNU GPL v2 and MIT License. 
The reason behind such licensing decision is the fact that 
it directly interoperates with DjvuLibre reference library what
according to some legal interprations of GNU GPL v2 license required release
of code which interoperates (links) with GNU GPL v2 licensed code to be released
under GNU GPL v2 license. To avoid any disputes we fulfill this requirement and
in order to make code avalaible under less restrictive open source license terms we 
release it under MIT License as well.
