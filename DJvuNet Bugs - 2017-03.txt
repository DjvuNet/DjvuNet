Major DjvuNet bugs:

1. Managed and unmanaged resources used by library are not realeased
	a) DjvuDocument does not close acquired file stream
	b) DjvuPage does not dispose image

2. IFF format is double read -> each FORM object is composed from two objects
	a) generalized FORM class FormChunk
	b) and its specific implementation i.e. DJVM, DJVI, DJVT or DJVU
	c) all parsing is done recursively (instead of sequantially for pages/recursively for each page content) in constructors - it creates huge call stack

3. Problem with concurrent programming model - multiple locks used for blocking access to assets - access contention is warranted
	a) images in DjvuPage

4. Inefficient implementation of set accessors for Properties in many different classes

5. Inefficient implementation of Pixle and PixelReference - due to usage it had huge impact on performance

6. Parsing bugs for some chunks

7. DjvuReader bugs in reading Big Endian integers

8. Implementation of graphics and parsing based mainly on signed int while reference implementation uses unsigned int (specification states INT32 but in comments it is explained that unsigned int was used)
